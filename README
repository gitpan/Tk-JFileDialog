NAME
    Tk::JFileDialog - A highly configurable File Dialog widget for Perl/Tk.

DESCRIPTION
    The widget is composed of a number of sub-widgets, namely, a listbox for
    files and (optionally) directories, an entry for filename, an (optional)
    entry for pathname, an entry for a filter pattern, a 'ShowAll' checkbox
    (for enabling display of .* files and directories), and three buttons,
    namely OK, Rescan, and Cancel. Note that the labels for all subwidgets
    (including the text for the buttons and Checkbox) are configurable for
    foreign language support.

SYNOPSIS
  Usage Description
        To use FileDialog, simply create your FileDialog objects during
        initialization (or at least before a Show). When you wish to display
        the FileDialog, invoke the 'Show' method on the FileDialog object;
        The method will return either a file name, a path name, or undef.
        undef is returned only if the user pressed the Cancel button.

  Example Code
        The following code creates a FileDialog and calls it. Note that
        perl5.002gamma is required.

             #!/usr/local/bin/perl -w

             use Tk;
             use Tk::JFileDialog;
             use strict;

             my($main) = MainWindow->new;
             my($Horiz) = 1;
             my($fname);

             my($LoadDialog) = $main->JFileDialog(-Title =>'This is my title',
                                                -Create => 0);

             $LoadDialog->configure(-FPat => '*pl',
                                   -ShowAll => 'NO');

             $main->Entry(-textvariable => \$fname)
                    ->pack(-expand => 1,
                           -fill => 'x');

             $main->Button(-text => 'Kick me!',
                          -command => sub {
                              $fname = $LoadDialog->Show(-Horiz => $Horiz);
                              if (!defined($fname)) {
                                  $fname = "Fine,Cancel, but no Chdir anymore!!!";
                                  $LoadDialog->configure(-Chdir =>'NO');
                              }
                          })
                    ->pack(-expand => 1,

             print "Exit Stage right!\n";

             exit;

METHODS
    *   The following non-standard method may be used with a FileDialog
        object

    *

  Show
            Displays the file dialog box for the user to operate. Additional
            configuration items may be passed in at Show-time In other
            words, this code snippet:

              $fd->Show(-Title => 'Ooooh, Preeeeeety!');

            is the same as this code snippet:

              $fd->configure(-Title => 'Ooooh, Preeeeeety!');
              $fd->Show;

CONFIGURATION
    Any of the following configuration items may be set via the configure
    (or Show) method, or retrieved via the cget method.

  *Flags*
    Flags may be configured with either 1,'true', or 'yes' for 1, or 0,
    'false', or 'no' for 0. Any portion of 'true', 'yes', 'false', or 'no'
    may be used, and case does not matter.

    *

  -Chdir
        *       Enable the user to change directories. The default is 1. If
                disabled, the directory list box will not be shown.

  -Create
        *       Enable the user to specify a file that does not exist. If
                not enabled, and the user specifies a non-existent file, a
                dialog box will be shown informing the user of the error
                (This Dialog Box is configurable via the EDlg* switches,
                below).

                default: 1

  -ShowAll
        *       Determines whether hidden files (.*) are displayed in the
                File and Directory Listboxes. The default is 0. The Show All
                Checkbox reflects the setting of this switch.

  -DisableShowAll
        *       Disables the ability of the user to change the status of the
                ShowAll flag. The default is 0 (the user is by default
                allowed to change the status).

  -Grab
        *       Enables the File Dialog to do an application Grab when
                displayed. The default is 1.

  -History
        *       Used with the "-HistFile" option. Specifies how many files
                to retain in the history list. The default is 0 (keep all).

  -HistFile
        *       Enables the keeping of a history of the previous files /
                directories selected. The file specified must be writable.
                If specified, a history of up to "-History" number of files
                will be kept and will be displayed in a "JBrowseEntry"
                combo-box permitting user selection.

  -Horiz
        *       True sets the File List box to be to the right of the
                Directory List Box. If 0, the File List box will be below
                the Directory List box. The default is 1.

  -SelDir
        *       If 1 or 2, enables selection of a directory rather than a
                file, and disables the actions of the File List Box. Setting
                to 2 allows selection of either a file OR a directory. The
                default is 0.

  *Special*
    *

  -FPat
        *       Sets the default file selection pattern. The default is '*'.
                Only files matching this pattern will be displayed in the
                File List Box.

  -Geometry
        *       Sets the geometry of the File Dialog. Setting the size is a
                dangerous thing to do. If not configured, or set to '', the
                File Dialog will be centered.

  -SelHook
        *       SelHook is configured with a reference to a routine that
                will be called when a file is chosen. The file is called
                with a sole parameter of the full path and file name of the
                file chosen. If the Create flag is disabled (and the user is
                not allowed to specify new files), the file will be known to
                exist at the time that SelHook is called. Note that SelHook
                will also be called with directories if the SelDir Flag is
                enabled, and that the FileDialog box will still be
                displayed. The FileDialog box should not be destroyed from
                within the SelHook routine, although it may generally be
                configured.

                SelHook routines return 0 to reject the selection and allow
                the user to reselect, and any other value to accept the
                selection. If a SelHook routine returns non-zero, the
                FileDialog will immediately be withdrawn, and the file will
                be returned to the caller.

                There may be only one SelHook routine active at any time.
                Configuring the SelHook routine replaces any existing
                SelHook routine. Configuring the SelHook routine with 0
                removes the SelHook routine. The default SelHook routine is
                undef.

  *Strings*
    The following two switches may be used to set default variables, and to
    get final values after the Show method has returned (but has not been
    explicitly destroyed by the caller)

    *   -File The file selected, or the default file. The default is ''.

        -Path The path of the selected file, or the initial path. The
        default is $ENV{'HOME'}.

  *Labels and Captions*
    For support of internationalization, the text on any of the subwidgets
    may be changed.

    *   -Title The Title of the dialog box. The default is 'Select File:'.

        -DirLBCaption The Caption above the Directory List Box. The default
        is 'Directories'.

        -FileLBCaption The Caption above the File List Box. The default is
        'Files'.

        -FileEntryLabel The label to the left of the File Entry. The Default
        is 'Filename:'.

        -PathEntryLabel The label to the left of the Path Entry. The default
        is 'Pathname:'.

        -FltEntryLabel The label to the left of the Filter entry. The
        default is 'Filter:'.

        -ShowAllLabel The text of the Show All Checkbutton. The default is
        'Show All'.

  *Button Text*
    For support of internationalization, the text on the three buttons may
    be changed.

    *   -OKButtonLabel The text for the OK button. The default is 'OK'.

        -RescanButtonLabel The text for the Rescan button. The default is
        'Refresh'.

        -CancelButtonLabel The text for the Cancel button. The default is
        'Cancel'.

  *Error Dialog Switches*
    If the Create switch is set to 0, and the user specifies a file that
    does not exist, a dialog box will be displayed informing the user of the
    error. These switches allow some configuration of that dialog box.

    *

  -EDlgTitle
        *       The title of the Error Dialog Box. The default is 'File does
                not exist!'.

  -EDlgText
        *       The message of the Error Dialog Box. The variables $path,
                $file, and $filename (the full path and filename of the
                selected file) are available. The default is *"You must
                specify an existing file.\n(\$filename not found)"*
